# Twitter Sentiment Analysis

This is a Django Web App that was created in 3 days for an induction to Computer Science at Essex University. This means obviously this will be a tad rough around the edges in some places... ðŸ˜…

It showcases:

- Django
- Natural Language Processing
- Google Maps API
- Map Quest Geocoding API
- Vue, ChartJS

It allows users to get an idea of the Sentiment of a certain topic and/or phrase that they enter using charts. It also allows users to easily access twitter's location data to know where people are located that are discussing a given topic using the Google Maps API.
